# JavaScript-Counter
This is a site developed to help count numbers to a certain limit (i.e 0 - 50)

The HTML file consist of div of container, holding up Texts and buttons (lower count and add count)

The CSS consist of bunch of styling properties

The JavaScrip file consists of few codes which helped in carrying out the functionality of the Website Created 
(i.e. enabling the lower count to function by subtracting 1 from the number after till it gets to 0 and it stops, also the add count adds 1 to numbers.)
